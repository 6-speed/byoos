build-you-own operating system

This is the fridge for make-your-own dinner night.
Where dinner is computer system.
It will involve:
- The PXELINUX part of SYSLINUX
- Some kind of virtual RAM driver
- Some kind of colour console driver
- Some kind of virtual disk access driver
- Some kind of international console keyboard driver
- Some kind of console graphical layer driver on a per-platform basis
- Some kind of sound card driver
- Some kind of windowing system
- Some networking support
- A look into what is required to run DOSBox as standalone
- A look at what is required to support the equivalent of VNC
- A look at what is required to support the MSYS toolchain

Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi Zero will be the first two platforms.
